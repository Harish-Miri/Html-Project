    <p> Unquenchable thirst for innovation and disruption; a rich legacy of technology and entrepreneurship; and a commitment to nurturing leaders who make a difference to the world has been the credo of BIT Mesra in the nearly six decades of its existence.

It has many firsts to its credit. It was the first in the country to establish a department dedicated to Space Engineering & Rocketry way back in 1964. It was also the first to develop a Science & Technology Entrepreneursâ€™ Park (BIT-STEP), on campus to instill the spirit of entrepreneurship in its students. Today, it is a vibrant place, bustling with student activities and innovative teaching methods that make it home to thousands of aspiring leaders of tomorrow. </p>
